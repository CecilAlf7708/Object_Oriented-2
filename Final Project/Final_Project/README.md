# OOP Final Project

##Synopsis
This project is a little fun recreation of a popular, older playstyle of arcade games

##Motivation
Growing up with games, I thought it would be nice to attempt to use my current skill in javafx to make something similar to what I played as a child

##How to Run
Simply pull the code from the "Final Project" folder to play

This potion was where I began the players lazer, was really fun once it first properly fired

##Tests
Use the Left and Right arrows to move and spacebar to shoot, and this was done using JUnit4 to test
